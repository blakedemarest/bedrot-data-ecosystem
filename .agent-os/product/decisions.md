# Technical & Product Decisions

## Completed Decisions

### 1. 5-Zone Data Lake Architecture
**Date**: October 2024  
**Decision**: Implement a 5-zone data lake (Landing → Raw → Staging → Curated → Archive)  
**Rationale**: 
- Provides clear data lineage and traceability
- Enables reprocessing from any stage
- Supports compliance and audit requirements
- Optimizes storage costs with zone-specific retention

**Trade-offs**:
- (+) Enterprise-grade data management
- (+) Fault tolerance and recovery
- (-) Increased storage requirements
- (-) More complex pipeline logic

### 2. Cookie-Based Authentication with Playwright
**Date**: November 2024  
**Decision**: Use browser automation for platform authentication  
**Rationale**:
- Bypasses complex OAuth implementations
- Handles 2FA automatically
- Maintains persistent sessions
- Works with platforms lacking APIs

**Trade-offs**:
- (+) Universal platform support
- (+) Handles complex auth flows
- (-) Requires browser resources
- (-) Potential brittleness with UI changes

### 3. SQLite for Initial Development
**Date**: September 2024  
**Decision**: Start with SQLite, plan PostgreSQL migration  
**Rationale**:
- Zero configuration for rapid prototyping
- File-based simplicity for development
- Sufficient for current data volumes
- Easy migration path to PostgreSQL

**Trade-offs**:
- (+) Fast development iteration
- (+) No server maintenance
- (-) Limited concurrent writes
- (-) No network access

### 4. Modular ETL Pipeline Design
**Date**: October 2024  
**Decision**: Service-specific processors with common interfaces  
**Rationale**:
- Isolates platform-specific logic
- Enables parallel development
- Simplifies testing and debugging
- Allows incremental platform additions

**Trade-offs**:
- (+) High maintainability
- (+) Easy to add new platforms
- (-) Some code duplication
- (-) Requires interface discipline

### 5. Next.js + FastAPI Stack
**Date**: November 2024  
**Decision**: Separate frontend and backend with API-first design  
**Rationale**:
- Best-in-class tools for each layer
- Independent scaling options
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modern developer experience

**Trade-offs**:
- (+) Technology flexibility
- (+) Team specialization possible
- (-) Additional deployment complexity
- (-) Network latency between services

## Pending Decisions

### 1. PostgreSQL Migration Timeline
**Options**:
1. Immediate migration (Q1 2025)
2. Gradual migration with dual-write
3. Defer until scale demands

**Considerations**:
- Current SQLite performing adequately
- PostgreSQL enables advanced features
- Migration complexity vs. immediate value

### 2. Machine Learning Infrastructure
**Options**:
1. Local GPU processing (RTX 4090)
2. Cloud ML services (AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex)
3. Hybrid approach

**Considerations**:
- $5000 local rig available
- Data privacy concerns
- Cost vs. scalability trade-offs

### 3. Real-time Processing Architecture
**Options**:
1. Apache Kafka + Spark Streaming
2. AWS Kinesis + Lambda
3. Custom WebSocket solution

**Considerations**:
- Current WebSocket implementation working
- Future scale requirements unclear
- Operational complexity

### 4. Multi-Artist Platform Strategy
**Options**:
1. Multi-tenant SaaS architecture
2. White-label deployments
3. Open-source framework

**Considerations**:
- Focus on BEDROT needs first
- Potential revenue opportunity
- Support and maintenance burden

### 5. Mobile Application Approach
**Options**:
1. Progressive Web App (PWA)
2. React Native cross-platform
3. Native iOS/Android apps

**Considerations**:
- PWA avoids app store requirements
- Native provides better performance
- Development resource constraints

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Alignment with 100M streams goal**
2. **Development velocity impact**
3. **Operational complexity**
4. **Cost effectiveness**
5. **Technical debt implications**

### Decision Process
1. Identify problem and constraints
2. Generate solution options
3. Evaluate against criteria
4. Document rationale and trade-offs
5. Set review checkpoint

### Review Schedule
- Quarterly architecture reviews
- Monthly technical debt assessment
- Post-incident decision validation
- Annual strategy alignment

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Starting simple with SQLite
- Modular architecture paying dividends
- Cookie-based auth surprisingly robust
- 5-zone architecture prevents data loss

### What We'd Do Differently
- Implement PostgreSQL from start
- Add monitoring earlier
- More comprehensive testing initially
- Better configuration management

### Technical Debt to Address
1. Configuration consolidation
2. Test coverage improvement
3. Documentation updates
4. Performance optimization
5. Security hardening
